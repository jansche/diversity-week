Preamble 
-------

Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This includes Microsoft events where we seek to create a respectful, friendly, and inclusive experience for all participants. As such, we do not tolerate harassing or disrespectful behavior, messages, images, or interactions by any event participant, in any form, at any aspect of the program including business and social activities, regardless of location. 


Purpose
-------

A primary goal of all the conferences and user groups that refer to this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).	 
 
This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in the Microsoft event Create:Frontend, happening on June 29 2020 and all related activities, as well as the consequences for	unacceptable behavior.
 
We invite all those who participate in our event to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.	 



Open Culture Citizenship
--------------------------------------

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open culture citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our communities. 
 
Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.	 
 
If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure Create:Frontend is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. 


Expected Behavior
-----------------


*	Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of Create:Frontend. 
*	Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. 
*	Attempt collaboration before conflict. 
*	Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. 
*	Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert our Code of Conduct team or other staff if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. 



Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in Diversity Week 2020 online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business.
